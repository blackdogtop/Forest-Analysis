# Forest-Analysis
*Forest is an app that helps you stay focused on the important things in life.* <br/>
Here is the official website of [forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc/)

This repo is used to analyse the existing focused data which can be generated by Forest. <br/>

The code can generate an analysis of Success Rate in a period of time. The images below show the **Success Rate every day in a month** and  **Monthly Success Rate in a year**. <br/>

![monthly average success rate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackdogtop/image-host/master/Forest-Analysis/monthly%20average%20success%20rate.png)

OR
it can generate an analysis of Plant Time in a period of time. The images below show the **Plant Time every day in a month** and **Monthly Plant Time every month in a year**
![plant time in a month](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackdogtop/image-host/master/Forest-Analysis/plant%20time%20in%20a%20month.png)
![monthly plant time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackdogtop/image-host/master/Forest-Analysis/monthly%20plant%20time.png)

To execute the analysis, first use FOREST app to generate your personal data, which can be found in *setting - accnount - exoport personal data*. Then download the csv file and replace the file path with your own in the code. After that, the analysis plots will be generated automatically.
