# Forest-Analysis
*Forest is an app that helps you stay focused on the important things in life.* <br/>
Here is the official website of [forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc/)

This repo is used to analyse the existing focused data which can be generated by Forest. <br/>

The code can generate an analysis of Success Rate in a period of time. The images below show the **Success Rate every day in a month** and  **Monthly Success Rate in a year**. <br/>

OR
it can generate an analysis of Plant Time in a period of time. The images below show the **Plant Time every day in a month** and **Monthly Plant Time in a year**

ALSO
the plant time every day in different weeks can be achieved. The images below show the **Days Plant Time in Different Weeks** and **The Average Days Plant Time in Weeks**

Other function or plots can be found in the code.

**EXECUTION**

***Data Collection*** <br/>
To execute the analysis, first use FOREST app to generate your personal data with csv format, which can be found in *setting - account - export personal data*. <br/>

***Install Dependencies***
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
***Run Code*** <br/>
Download the FOREST csv file and replace the file path with your own in the code. After that, the analysed figures will be generated automatically. <br/>

*UPDATE 07.12.2020* <br/>
Now, command lines are support to generate analysis. <br/>
*e.g.*
```
python3 Forest-Analysis -i ./Plants_of_me.csv -t month
```
*Command Line Arguments* <br/>
* `-i` or `--input_source`: the FOREST csv file path, default with *./Plants_of_me.csv* which the dot **"."** is the current file path. <br/>
* `-t` or `--time_period`: the period of time will be analysed, default with *month*. <br/>
