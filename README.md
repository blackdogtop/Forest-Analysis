# Forest-Analysis
*Forest is an app that helps you stay focused on the important things in life.* <br/>
Here is the official website of [forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc/)

This repo is used to analyse the existing focused data which can be generated by Forest. <br/>

The code can generate an analysis of Success Rate in a period of time. The images below show the **Success Rate every day in a month** and  **Monthly Success Rate in a year**. <br/>

![DATE - AVERAGE SUCCESS RATE bar chart in month](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackdogtop/image-host/master/Forest-Analysis/DATE%20-%20AVERAGE%20SUCCESS%20RATE%20bar%20chart%20in%20month.png)

OR
it can generate an analysis of Plant Time in a period of time. The images below show the **Plant Time every day in a month** and **Monthly Plant Time in a year**

ALSO
the plant time every day in different weeks can be achieved. The images below show the **Days Plant Time in Different Weeks** and **The Average Days Plant Time in Weeks**
![DAYs in WEEK - PLANT TIME bar chart days in different week](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackdogtop/image-host/master/Forest-Analysis/DAYs%20in%20WEEK%20-%20PLANT%20TIME%20bar%20chart%20days%20in%20different%20week.png)
![DAYs in WEEK - AVERAGE PLANT TIME bat chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackdogtop/image-host/master/Forest-Analysis/DAYs%20in%20WEEK%20-%20AVERAGE%20PLANT%20TIME%20bat%20chart.png)

Other function or plots can be found in the code.

To execute the analysis, first use FOREST app to generate your personal data, which can be found in *setting - account - export personal data*. Then download the csv file and replace the file path with your own in the code. After that, the analysis plots will be generated automatically.
